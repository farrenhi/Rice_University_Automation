There are only two files in this folder.

1. First one is for data procesing. It would load the raw data file (.csv files) and process the data. It would be saved as .mat file as output.

File: a00_all_07_data_process_includingcathode_twosheet.m

As you could see that the file naming was not clear and not short, the code was my earlier year accomplishment. There were a lot to be improved.

2. Second one is for data analysis and visulization. It would load the previous processed file (.mat file) and plot them out. The plotting style is fine-tuned for the need of either journal publication or data visualization.

File: anode_cycle_performance_v7_clean_twosheets_only_cycle.m

There were many plotting codes, but I just uploaded this one for reference. Actually, I should have just created plotting funtions instead of many .m files. All in all, the code was created in my early professional life. It was built to solve the immediate problems.
